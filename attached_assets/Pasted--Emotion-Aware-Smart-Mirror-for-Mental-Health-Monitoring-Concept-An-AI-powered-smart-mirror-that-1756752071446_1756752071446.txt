"Emotion-Aware Smart Mirror for Mental Health Monitoring"

Concept:

An AI-powered smart mirror that detects a person's facial emotions (via CNN) when they look at themselves in the morning, and gives a short report based on their mood, stress level, and routine health habits — something like:

"You seem a bit stressed today, try some deep breathing."

"You looked happy yesterday, but a bit down today. Is everything okay?"

"Detected dark circles under your eyes — did you get enough sleep?"
